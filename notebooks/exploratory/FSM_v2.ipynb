The word 'grail' evokes images of crusaders traveling endlessly in search of something that may not even exist. Price has little to do with it, but availability does more so. If a speedmaster represents several months wages then perhaps you could call it a grail, but the fact that it sits on the shelf of every watch store in a few miles radius undermines that point. But if you walked hot coals for it then sure, it's your grail. The perfect grail watch is something that is rare and that you have to endure a lengthy search for. So not just any speedmaster but one with a particular serial number or provenance perhaps - again not necessarily a very expensive one. But rarity and expense often combine to make something near impossible for us to obtain. Why should you have to wear it everyday? An every day watch that is easy to find is simply a watch?! \n",

He could easily have chosen a $200 Seiko or Citizen diver that is just as suitable for diving and much more suitable as a humble timepiece on the wrist.

Ie was it design ping-pong? Ideas that didn't make it, etc. One would guess keeping a Speedmaster a Speedmaster that there aren't that many variables but there definitely are : can't help to look at the ck2998 in comparison ... looks like a different watch (to me at least). With the SpeedyTuesday they nailed it totally (brushed steel bracelet (no polish) similar to that on the mkii reissue might have also gone down rather well, but no complaints).

      "This piece really drives home to me while I like watches but not (generally) watch people: they are all about looks. I use my watches to tell the time (and bottom time), and I find the date function to be incredibly useful. And as you beautifully illustrate in this article, the more readible the date the better the utility. I have both Rolex and Tudors that I wear, and the cyclops on my vintage Tudor and Rolex dates is both useful and well-integrated in terms of style. The only thing don't like about my more modern Tudors (Pelagos and Heritage Chrono) is the difficulty in reading the date compared with the cyclops equipped models. Also, I want to point out something re: dive watches and dates. I wish I had a Cellini for every time I've heard \"dive watches don't need a date\" on forums and elswhere, typically stated by people who don't dive. When I was working as a marine biologist, I spend as much time filling out logs and reports while at sea as I did underwater, and the date was indispensable. As for saturation diving (and I think Jack may have actually pointed this out, bless him) when you're weeks living in a saturation bell having the date on your timepiece is a handy thing to have, especially if you lose other references like internet capability when it drops out due to location problems. Thanks for the piece, Cara, as you're the only person at Hodinkee I can tolerate (although Jack is growing on me, thanks to his charming, relaxed demeanor on the youtube videos. What?

It's probably too big for my wrist, its design is oh-so-70s (so it's cool now, but maybe not in a few years when we all come to our senses and re-remember that the 70s were not the greatest years for design), and it's the first modern run from a once defunct manufacturer that has resurfaced, so initial quality might be a gamble. But it looks So. Freakin. Cool. I absolutely love the gray dial (did I just say I love gray? who in their right mind feels passionate about gray?!?), the barrel-shaped case, and the matte finish. Oh, and it's a racing chronograph that's water resistant to 200m, so I can time how long it takes me to escape from my submerged racecar? Take up submarine racing (Is this a thing? This should be a thing)? Time my laundry FROM INSIDE THE WASHING MACHINE (of course I wouldn't do this, I don't want the watch to shrink)? I don't know, but I'll figure something out that makes full use of both features.\n",

But the author is exactly right: there used to be a time when the higher middle-class, the relatively well-off, could afford such a watch. I can understand this watch at around $15,000, no problem. But $24k ?! Maybe not. \n",
      "\n",
      "In principle, this is very much my kind of watch. In practice, it misses the mark in several ways. The Saxonia 37 (in Thin or original edition), to which this new Vacheron is being compared, succeeds in terms of design where this one doesn't, and is useful for pointing out what Vacheron got wrong here, which I say despite the fact that on the whole I have more affection for Vacheron than I do for Lange.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll get back to that, but first a few general comments. Starting with the most trivial: the name irks me. That a 36mm watch needs to be called \"Small\" shows how far the rot has spread. The watch is meant to evoke traditional watches, but in that context, 36mm is very much on the large size. Jack says it could have appeared via time machine from 1955, but am I mistaken in believing that, in fact, men's watches in those days were more typically in the 33mm-34mm range? While on the matter of size, and while I'm being so rash as to publicly disagree with Jack Forster, I'll pick up where Jack leaves off in quite rightly undermining his own assertion about there being nothing objectively wrong with large watches by mentioning leisure suits. The reference is apt: leisure suites were ghastly because they were loud and showy and vulgar. Just like the huge watches that have still not abandoned the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now about the movement. That's a regulated balance in there, if I'm not mistaken. A traditional high-end watch, certainly at this price, should have a free-sprung balance. Carlos Perez had a beautiful series on TimeZone about Vacheron, called The Decay of the Angel (like the Mishima novel) in which he chronicled the gradual decline, in the 20th Century, of the great Vacheron name, and I remember him pointing out that one of the symptoms of this decline was that Vacheron had started using regulated balances in its watches. While the brand has arguably regained some lustre in more recent times, this bad habit seems not entirely to have been left behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Staying with the movement: while it's always nice to see wheels turning, it's even nicer to see bridges and plates whose contours run parallel to each other. The movement in this watch, while already beautiful, could be greatly improved if the metal hadn't been cut away near to the click but instead followed the contour of the central bridge and if the the balance cock did likewise instead of being that rather brutal straight line. As it is, it looks haphazard and unharmonious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly regarding the movement: if this is a traditional \"dress watch\", it would have been better to make it hand-wound. That is of course nothing but a purist opinion or personal preference, but that's why we're all here anyway, right? The fact is that this is not strictly a \"dress watch\" anyway but more of a daily watch whose design is particularly dressy. (One note about the automatic - I agree with others who are seeing ball bearings there. They seem quite unmistakeable. It looks to me like the jewel is for the center arbor.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning the watch over, one finds a palette of missed opportunities. Here is where the Saxonia 37, and particularly the Thin edition, gets much more right. Between a dress watch, on the one hand, and on the other, a daily watch for those of us not blessed with permanent leisure, the key functional differences are: a) no date, b) no seconds hand, and c) if you Do have a seconds hand, it should be a small seconds. The Saxonia 37 Thin is the most pure expression of this, while the original 37 does have a seconds hand but a small one. Here we have not only a seconds hand but a central one, and, even worse, a date! I have stopped complaining every time a date window ruins a dial, because it happens so often and one doesn't want to be TOO much of a bore. But here it is so egregious as to demand vehement condemnation. How COULD they?! Just LOOK at that travesty -- how it brutally cuts off the otherwise elegant marker at 6, how it clumsily punctures an otherwise serene dial to artlessly display some very middle-class information (and no I'm not being pretentious; I'm a hard-working middle-class person myself). Beyond these clear misses, not much more to say other than that the hands are inelegant - sure, the hands of a dress-watch should be simple, but their width and taper and should be felicitious (and the seconds hand looks, as Jack hints, quite awful - very much as if - as already pointed out by others here - stamped cheaply from a sheet of metal and stuck on without further ado).\n",
      "\n",
      "Vacheron does make a dress watch, the Patrimony 81180/000G-9117, that gets right much of what this \"Small\" gets wrong. It's got no date, no seconds, no automatic. But it's 40mm across. Why couldn't they just shrink THAT one down to 36mm? \n",

      "Swiss brand executives are funny people.  None of them wants to admit that the majority of watch sales during the US boom period were from Chinese tourist, and US domestic/Student Chinese sending product back to china on a low dollar value exchange rate.  Especially at the high end segment where Swiss watch export value figure matters most, instead of volume.  With the high dollar, and strict restrictions of doing this by the Chinese government, is it any wonder why the US has not grown but mainland China is!?!  Of course....they have pretty much forced their citizens to buy there.  As for their optimism of growth in the US market....what do you want them to say....if you say otherwise your bound to get canned after a couple of years.  Most of these guys are new from the recent massive executive shakeups in the groups.  They cant do and say the same things as the people they replaced.

      "Excellent write-up, Jack. I've been watching auctions for a while now... looking for my own opportunistic purchase I suppose. Here's what I've been wondering that might be worth Hodinkee exploring: Is it my imagination, or are the auction estimates seemingly always low once the hammer falls? I look at some of these auctions (typically Christie's or Phillips) and think I'm pondering a $10K purchase (with the auction house estimating $7K to $12K) and the watch sells for $20K?! What's up with that? Has that historically been the norm or is this a recent development? Are the auction houses just creating a little \"false hope\" to get more people in the bid queue? Is this a result of the high profile auctions happening recently and a little \"proximity effect\" (PNPND, Only Watch)? I realize both of those had a charity element, but the numbers even on everyday auctions, more often than not, end higher than estimates. I would love it if Hodinkee would put some editorial muscle behind these questions for all of us exploring the auction method of procuring a great watch! \n",

My 1985 Datejust, which I wore every day until I got the Daytona a year ago was about 5 or 6 seconds a day fast.  I usually just reset it every couple of months.

I think knowing they were damaged (potentially during front line conflict), sent back, repaired and then posted straight back to the coal face only adds to their rich history and value. Having a watch with a replacement crystal/ hand/ mechanical cog etc which needed repaired because it was damaged by for example, a fleeting bullet, piece of explosion shrapnel or due to wearer damage during a close combat encounter (all very dramatic and far fetched I know, but not straying too far from the realms of possibility), would only add value in my opinion.

Let's see the comments on the movement: \"An automatic movement ticking at 4Hz, the GP03300-0027 has some 248 components (including 32 jewels) and *boasts Côtes de Genève finishing* and a power reserve of no less than 46 hours. *Nicely finished* and visible through the 1966 WW.TC’s display case back, during my use this movement kept excellent time and operated without issue.\". Let's take a look to the pictures and we will notice that GP are using lacquered blue screws; deceiving lacquered screws. A $ 13K watch with lacquered blue screws and the only comment from the reviewer is about the côtes de Genève and the conclusion is \"nicely finished\"?! No, my dear Jack, that's not acceptable. The duty of any journalist is, because you write about what you like and because you like the watch, to point out at those lacquered screws and claim that a price close to HH and lacquered screws are not compatible, that that's something to fix and that GP's value proposition gets diminished when they put an element with the only intention of deceive. And if you don't do that, it's only because of two possible options: because in the course of one week you didn't notice the lacquered screws, or you think that it's not relevant at the price tag (namely, ignorance) or because you are purposely avoiding any mention to that (namely, dishonesty).\n",

      "It depends on why a Milllennium Man or Woman would purchase a wrist watch.  It’s either to conveniently tell the time or as a gaudy badge advertising wealth... often interpreted as “I’m rich, please mug me”.  The beauty of any of the big 3 and the  mechanical marvels as demonstrations of the watchmakers skill is undeniable.  I’m not poor, or rich, just the average middle manager, and enjoy wearing my classic Rolex  ‘subbie’ and also the marvel of the Omega moon watch.  My opinion is simple, I wear a watch to tell the time and require quality, reliability and sufficient ‘class’ (sadly stolen by the myriad of fakes polluting the market) to demonstrate my ‘good taste’ in watch selection. Fortunately only fake people need to own fake products, so if challenged by a Rolex ‘faker’, immersion of both time pieces  in a glass of water rapidly settles the argument.\n",

NASA tested 1700 watches to destruction when kitting out the Apollo missions. A rugged, relatively inexpensive production Omega Speedmaster was the only device still functioning at the conclusion of testing.  In my opinion anything less than the watch which brought Apollo 13 back to Earth fails to satisfy my STBO criteria.  It looks fantastic, it’s a great stop watch, I can afford it and apparently a Saturn V rocket can be dropped on it and it will still work!  As a kid, to know Buzz Aldrin wore that watch when he and Mr. Armstrong simultaneously (at the same time, together in the LEM) BOTH landed on the moon in the LEM, I just had to have one.\n",

Believe it or not, my simple requirements can’t be found on the net.  The obvious manufacturers must be Omega or Rolex, both of whom get very close to what I want.  Rolex have a great ‘design your own watch application’, in my professional opinion it’s a first class user friendly application.  Simple requirement is to get the watch I ‘designed’ in a 40mm case and not 36mm as produced.  Omega make life a little harder, two choices made it to final selection, a gold speedmaster with moonphase bonus, but only offered a ghastly rubber band in place of a gold bracelet.  Second offering isn’t bad, gives day and date, but has a horrible brown face, comes a bad second when compared with the 36mm. Rolex, with a beautiful green dial with a touch of bling.  However, IF the day date Rolex was 40mm, I’d have my dream watch.  IF the gold, day date Omega had a more interesting dial, I’d have my dream watch.\n",

LONG overdue given the importance of this object!   I also really like the dial color and texture.  It's not easy to do a sandwich dial and NOT have it look totally ripped off from Panerai.   This accomplishes that goal very very nicely.  The angles of the bezel (and crown) also look great and not blatantly derivative of anything in the past.  Well done!  The whole piece looks quasi-vintage (in a pleasantly crusty \"millennia old\" sort of way, lol) without dripping in mid-20th century \"faux-tina\".  I like it a great deal!  Finally, the channel on the back is a really REALLY great idea and something I am a bit surprised to have not seen being used by other brands in the past.  \n",

      "Now, I would not be much of a \"watch guy\" (or much of a Greek for that matter, LOL!) if I didn't have some criticisms.  First, not related to the watch itself....but, in this review, how is there no lume shot?!?!?!  I would bet that is where this watch really shines (no pun intended).  Also, please tell me that the rotating disk is lumed just as the numerals and hour markers are!  It would be a shame not to accentuate that  VERY  important design element.   As others have noted, I would also have an issue with size.   Getting the \"lug to lug\" to 50mm or less (regardless of bezel/case diameter) would be ideal.  How about some drilled lugs to go with that for easy strap swaps?  That bezel is also going to be a scratch magnet I suspect.  Finding a way to do a replaceable insert (perhaps sell two spares in the same or maybe different colors along with the watch) or simply lacquering the top of the current bezel (seiko mm300 style) in a color and texture matching the outermost color on the dial would probably be best.   Failing that, I would think at least filling in all the bezel markers in an appropriate color would be necessary to break up the mass of monochromatic steel that is the bezel and also increase legibility for its intended purpose.   In terms of visual balance, I would also drop the depth rating from the dial.  It's engraved on the back after all and would make 6:00 look less crowded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Penultimately, and I get why you did it on multiple fronts, I am not sure that the steel-toned minute hand works aesthetically.  I would think of at least offering the option of it being gilt to match the hour hand.  Finally, I think you might have tripped up a bit going to the trouble of creating a monocoque case with a display back.  With the right set of gaskets and proper design (no display back) the water and/or helium-proof nature of the watch could probably be improved by eliminating the rear glass.  It would also give off a more \"toolish\" vibe which is what you are going for, obviously.   \n",

Yet the boutiques I've spoken to have no idea when they're receiving any?! I thought when a company, at least an organized one, officially launches a product it's ready to go?! People have complained about the price, which is not that terrible, but what is terrible is a failure to launch.

I’m so sick of these brands like Rolex putting out total uninspired garbage at Basel. Batman with an “updated movement” on a jubilee.....blah blah. Perhaps it’s because I work in tech and I’m consistently innovating that while I may not be a buyer of this watch in the gulf color, I appreciate the design effort and material quality at a reasonable price.  I recently let go of a GMT II that I wore every day for two years for 12k. Are you serious?! I paid 6.5k for the watch used. Profiting off those so desperate to wear ROLEX on their wrist is more exciting than anything Rolex has put out since the original Hulk sub. Is the GMT II an awesome watch? Absolutely. Is it worth 12k? Hell no. I wish the watch community could appreciate design and material more than brand. Micro companies turned into Unicorns in my business and put the established out of work. Maybe the same will happen in this space when folks refuse to pay 12k for watches artificially held in limited supply. \n",

And finally this is not a tourbillon that breaks the mould in a revolutionary way, that required painstaking research and development, it's very much so just another marginally more technologically involved tourbillon than the average, as unexciting and forgettable an example as most other self aggrandizing pretentious tourbillons out there.\n",

      "\n",
      "You would not be able to resell this watch for a fifth of the asking price, a day after buying this, having never worn the watch. $50k, $60k retail, maybe, it would still be a hard sell for a connoisseur, GO better discount you like their lives depended on it, but at 150k, AND EURO on top of that, it's just shameless, divorced from reality, with appeal only for people that have no clue about watchmaking or the market, but do respond well to marketing claptrap, that would not know to tell an innovative watchmaking concept from a painted nail anyway. \n",
      "\n",
      "YES, there are other watches out there in this niche, skeleton/ half skeleton time tellers with a technological advancement twist, and some ask far more even for even more diluted technological updates, but some companies have names that can back them up on a secondary market. GO?! GO survives on retail $5000 watches that they sell at a discount, that get resold for $3000!!! \n",
      "\n",
      "So, when all is said and done, when we've looked at the pictures, and that feeling that this watch is not even finished properly but rather abandoned in some sort of mid way to being completed state, the only reasonable opinion to have is that this is such an insane value to asking price proposition that I don't understand how Hodinkee didn't even mention it. Seems like THAT is the story here. A watch so divorced from the reality of what it is offering that it just begs the question - why isn't anyone asking a big fat: WHAT?!\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone is contemplating getting this, know that you could get a pristine preowned Patek 5970J-001 for the money, and that's a serious watch. Or a platinum A. Lange & Söhne Rattrapante Perpetual Calendar 1815,  again preowned and pristine, that would tickle all and any complicated & prestigious watch itches. Minus the - this is state of the art, technological advancement watchmaking in 2019. Because this watch from GO is not advancing watchmaking, it's just scrambling for some weird twist in a complication just for the bragging rights, to compete in a market that it doesn't belong into.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and the Lange and Patek also come minus the cheap eye candy for the uninitiated; no cheap engraving while having components that look like they were taken from a cheap ETA, and nobody bothered to give them 3 seconds of a broad polish; these two watches don't waste your time with cheap tricks, the hard work went where it's making a difference, in finishing and useful, road tested complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you still, however, want a half skeleton, pointless state of the art watch with yet another technology advancement trick, look into companies where you don't throw 100K out the window a day after the purchase. GO is not a player in this game, they're trying, but if you read Hodinkee, you should know better than to be taken advantage of in such a way.\n",
      "\n",
      "AND Hodinkee should at least mention something about the inadequacies of the pricing. You don't owe your readership warnings, but you might extend that favor, especially for a particularly bad purchase, especially for such an unfinished looking watch, and especially for as plain a tech gimmick as this watch is proposing. \n",

It's aggravating that I can't do that on the official website of a company that is so small that there are barely any watches they make on any secondary market.\n",

I can't extend that charitability towards Habring2, I'm afraid. Let me also state that  I don't agree with the practice, regardless of the size of the company making use of it. But ok. Rolex can get a pass. Behemoths can be excused. Besides, Rolex, being the brand they are, with a limited offering of models  and with incredible press coverage, present with retailers everywhere and on any and all secondary markets, it's not a hassle finding pricing information, it's quite a simple matter. \n",

If the watch was actually used, then the condition will be worn. But how worn is too worn? Granted, some wear to the outside of the case is to be expected. But what good is it to have all original parts, and a watch that looks like a horrible mess, or doesn't even run?!  In that case you have an \"original\" piece of junk! I like to strike a balance between the two. Rolexes were made to be used and serviced when needed. Find one in as good of condition as possible and do not fret if some parts have been replaced, or re-conditioned. This is to be expected. I would rather have replacement parts than originals for parts that get a lot of wear, like gears, crystals, and straps. And reconditioned dials and bracelets instead of originals in very poor condition. In most vintage watches, they will already have been replaced, hopefully with correct parts. \n",
