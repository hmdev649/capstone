# Knowledge Assistant for Comment Systems
I discovered a love for mechanical watches and horology about three years ago when I became a regular reader of Hodinkee, one of the premier media companies covering the art of horology and all things watches. Over its decade-long existence it has garnered and grown a passionate and engaged audience, and created a rich trove of high quality horological journalism. 

As new readers come to the site, or casual readers return, often the comments will contain questions that have previously been written about in depth on the site. Having a way to refer these users to those articles could help improve the user experience, grow engagement and time spent across the entire corpus of articles, and hopefully lead to a higher conversion rate for the commercial side of the business. 

I would like to build a recommendation system that answers these questions in the comments by referring readers to Hodinkee articles that answer their questions with a high degree of confidence. The general principle should be easily carried over to other, similar online communities with highly engaged audiences.
